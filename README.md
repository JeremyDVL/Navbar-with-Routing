## <ins>What it does

This is a responsive navigation bar that uses bootstrap, routing and useState along with some custom css to take the user from page to page.

## <ins>How to Run

Clone Repo into editor => Open terminal in VS Code or other editor => run "npm start" for live server

  Once installed you can click the links in the navbar to display text on the screen.  You can also adjust the screen wide and narrow to see the text and alignment of the navbar change.  In narrow mode the fa-bars make the menu appear and dissapear and there are also a few dynamic transitions just for fun.

## <ins>Future improvements

Improve the styling.  Add more content and images.
